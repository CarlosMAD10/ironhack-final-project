# Ironhack final project

By Carlos Entrena

# Project description

In order to make intelligent investment decisions in the stock market, we would like to get some experience working with index and stock time series, and assess the possibility of predicting future prices.

In order to do so, we will work with a Kaggle dataset called Stock Exchange Data. It comprises information from 14 stock market indexes spanning from 1986 until 2021. Additionally, we will try using effectively one or several APIs that provide stock information.

# Project goals

1. Become familiar with stock market time series.
2. Create reusable tools for analysing and visualising stock information.
3. Assess the possibility of predicting the future price of a stock based on unrelated index information, using machine learning techniques.
4. Study the API environment to access and use stock market information.
